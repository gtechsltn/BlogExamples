# How to test HttpClient inside API Tests

I am a great fan of API tests. I do like to utilize the `WebApplicationFactory` for this. I even wrote some articles about this in the past "[*Introduction to WebApplicationFactory*](https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/cd62475b-2c7d-4ce2-bd97-9670f91ebac8/introduction-to-webapplicationfactory)". But what if we need to "mock" `HttpClient` calls inside our tests?
